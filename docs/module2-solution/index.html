				Almonds
			</div>
			<div class="panel-content">
Almonds are a fantastic source of antioxidants. Antioxidants help to protect against oxidative stress, which can damage molecules in cells and contribute to aging and diseases like cancer. The powerful antioxidants in almonds are largely concentrated in the brown layer of the skin. For this reason, blanched almonds (skin removed) are not the best choice from a health perspective. A clinical trial of 60 male smokers found that 84 grams (about 3 ounces) of almonds per day reduced oxidative stress biomarkers by 23-34%, over a 4 week period.

				Cheese
			</div>
			<div class="panel-content">
Cheese is an excellent source of protein. One thick slice of cheddar cheese (28 g) contains about 6.7 g of protein, which is similar to what you get from a glass of milk. The majority of proteins in cheese belong to a family of milk proteins called casein. Milk proteins are of excellent quality, rich in essential amino acids, and highly digestible. Casein is the largest family of proteins in milk, the most abundant of which is alpha-casein. It has some unique health effects and may promote lower blood pressure and increased absorption of minerals from the digestive tract.

				Lemonade
			</div>
			<div class="panel-content">
The health benefits of lemon are due to its many nourishing elements like vitamin C, vitamin B6, vitamin A, vitamin E, folate, niacin, thiamin, riboflavin, pantothenic acid, copper, calcium, iron, magnesium, potassium, zinc, phosphorus, and protein. It is a fruit that contains flavonoids, which are composites that contain antioxidant and cancer-fighting properties. People use it to make lemonade by mixing lemon juice and water. Many people also use it as a washing agent, because of its ability to remove stains. The scent of lemons can also repel mosquitoes.
